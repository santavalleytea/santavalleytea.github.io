        <h1>Learning Pure Mathematics</h1>
        <h2>Where We Are Heading</h2>
        <p>
            For most of my life, mathematics felt…dull. It was all about memorizing formulas
            , plugging in numbers and spitting out an answer. Rinse and repeat until it 
            becomes second nature. I only realized much later — embarrassingly later 
            than most of my peers — that this isn’t what mathematics really is. 
            Of course, sometimes you are required to just crunch numbers in the way 
            I described, but once I reached university, I started seeing what math actually 
            looked like: symmetries in polygons, the way in which objects deform, 
            the continuity of a function — and how all of these ideas somehow connect. 
            Even the philosophy and history of mathematics turned out to be full of depth 
            and complexity.
            <br><br>
            As someone who wasn’t exactly a “math person” in high school, I’ve come to 
            believe that the issue isn’t that some people are just naturally good at it 
            (which is a whole philosophical rabbit hole —  one I'll definitely write about 
            later), but rather how mathematics is introduced. It’s rarely shown for what it 
            truly is and can be; a creative, beautiful disciple. Think of it like this — if 
            someone forced you to play the guitar by repeating a single scale endlessly, 
            without ever hearing an actual song, you would probably lose interest quite 
            early on. That, in my opinion, is how math is often taught.
            <br><br>
            Now, I will address that there is no sugar coating the difficulty in 
            learning mathematics. Once you get past the basics, things become quite 
            abstract, and proofs start to demand real structure and precision. But this 
            is also where the fun starts. This guide is my attempt to share a roadmap for 
            learning pure mathematics.
            <br><br>
            The aim is simple: to help you navigate the world of pure mathematics —  
            to know where to start, what to expect and which books, in my opinion, are 
            best to pick up. Each section gives a short overview of the topic, why it 
            matters and a few trusted resources that I’ve used to learn from. My hope 
            is that it makes the overwhelming landscape of mathematics feel slightly less 
            intimidating, and hopefully, a little more exciting.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Just Before We Start</h2>
        <p>
            Before we dive straight into the roadmap, it’s worth mentioning that this 
            guide doesn’t start completely from scratch. We won’t be covering things 
            like “what are numbers” or “how to add and subtract”. It assumes you already 
            have some familiarity with foundational high-school mathematics — algebra, 
            functions, trigonometry and basic geometry.
            <br><br>
            That said, you don’t need to remember everything you learned in school. 
            A decent grasp of these topics is more than enough. If you feel rusty, 
            I highly recommend brushing up with <i><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math">
            Khan Academy's</a></i> mathematics courses.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Motivated</h2>
        <p>
            Here are a few sources that I’ve personally found inspiring — 
            each one captures the beauty and creativity of mathematics in its own way:
            <ul style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li><i><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Letters-Young-Mathematician-Ian-Stewart/dp/0465082327">

                <li><i><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Man-Who-Loved-Only-Numbers/dp/0786884061">
                    The Man Who Only Loved Numbers</a></i>by Paul Hoffman</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGp77CmhhLw">
                    Finding X: A Mathematical Short Film</a></i>by Tibees</li>
                <li><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_L-fp8gDzY">
                    What Makes People Engage with Math</a></i>, a TED Talk by Grant Sanderson</li>
            </ul>
            You do not need to go through all of them, or any at all if you are already 
            motivated enough. They are simply what gave me that extra spark of curiosity 
            and motivation to keep learning. That being said, I still highly recommend it. 
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>How to Study Mathematics</h2>
        <p>
            While your choice of textbook definitely matters, how you study is 
            ultimately the most important factor.
            People will give their own opinions on study techniques that are 
            effective to them, so it is important to note that my opinion in itself 
            is subjective. So take the following as suggestions rather than rules — 
            they’re a collection of techniques that are widely recommended and have worked out 
            well for me
            <ol style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li><b>First Read — Grasping the Big Picture </b></li>
                <ul style="margin-left: 3em;">
                    <li>
                        Pick a chapter or section and read through it casually. 
                        Write down the key definitions, theorem formulas, and a 
                        brief sketch/outline of each proof. Don’t worry about mastering 
                        everything yet — just get familiar with the ideas.

                    <li>
                        Once you have a general picture of what’s going on, try to 
                        reconstruct what you read without looking. Rewrite definitions 
                        and proofs from memory, and explain them aloud as if you’re 
                        teaching someone. You’ll quickly notice the gaps in your 
                        understanding, which will be your cut to go back and fill them in.

                    <li>
                        This is where real learning happens. Work through several problems 
                        from each section — say, the first 4 to 6 exercises — and then pick 
                        a few that seem particularly interesting or challenging. It is okay 
                        to check solutions later, but make sure you’ve genuinely wrestled 
                        with the problem first.

        <h2>Mathematics Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
            The following are recommended readings for each topic area. Note that you do 
            not need to go through every book listed — one per topic is enough. I’ve 
            included multiple options since different explanations and styles appeal to 
            different kinds of learners.

        <h3>1. Calculus I, II, III</h3>
        <p>
            Calculus is one of the cornerstones of modern mathematics and one that most 
            students would have encountered in high school (or earlier). It builds the 
            foundation for understanding change, motion and accumulation — concepts that 
            appear across many disciplines such as physics and engineering. Topics range 
            from limits and derivatives to integrals, infinite series and multivariable 
            extensions.

                Calculus: Early Transcendentals (8th Edition)</i></a> by James Stewart
                 — Arguably the most well-known modern calculus textbook. It is quite 
                 comprehensive and covers single variable, multivariable and vector 
                 calculus, in addition to an introduction to differential equations. 
                 Keep in mind that this amounts to about three to four semesters of study, 
                 hence the density of the book.

        </p>
        <h3>2. Proof Writing</h3>
        <p>
            We are now ready to learn how to write proofs, which is where you truly begin to think like a mathematician. Think of this as the transition from applying formulas to constructing logical arguments — the bridge between computational math and pure reasoning.
        </p>
        <h4>Recommended Readings:</h4>
        <p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li><i><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Book-Proof-Richard-H-Hammack/dp/0989472124">
                Book of Proof</i></a> by Richard Hammack — Highly recommended for beginners. It is free, clear and focuses on building intuition for logic and proof techniques.
                </li>
                <li><a href=""><i>How to Prove It 
                </i></a> by Daniel J. Velleman — Another excellent introduction. Slightly more structured, with more exercises in logic and set theory. Both are great starting points, so pick whichever style you prefer.

            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>3. Linear Algebra</h3>
        <p>
            Here, we study vector spaces and linear transformations, one of the most powerful tools in mathematics and can be considered the language of geometry, computer science and physics alike. It introduces ideas such as span, basis, eigenvalues and diagonalization that recur throughout mathematics.

        </p>
        <h3>4. Group Theory</h3>
        <p>
            This is where things start to become more abstract and was definitely the point where I started to struggle more than I did in the past. Group theory explores symmetry — the mathematical study of transformations that preserves structure. It is the foundation of modern algebra and appears in pretty much everything (this is also one of my favorite areas of mathematics!).

        <h3>5. Real Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            A trip back to calculus,  real analysis rigorously formalizes it — limits, continuity, differentiation and integration — using precise definitions and proofs. It explores understanding the “why” in calculus.

        <h3>7. Complex Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Regarded as one of the most beautiful and elegant areas in mathematics, especially compared to its precursor real analysis. Complex analysis extends calculus into the complex plane — where differentiation and integration behave in a surprisingly elegant manner.

        <h3>8. Rings, Fields & Galois Theory</h3>
        <p>
            I have already listed two from the above as one of my favorite areas, but to date, this is my utmost favorite area of mathematics that I have learnt. This area explores the algebraic structures underlying arithmetic and polynomial equations. It culminates in Galois theory — the link between symmetry and solvability, and one of the crown jewels of pure mathematics.

        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I’m currently a university student passionate about mathematics, security and video games! </p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Singapore-born Japanese currently in my third year undergraduate degree studying 
                    mathematics at the University of Sydney. 
                    <br><br>
                    My interest lies in pure mathematics, specifically in understanding algebraic and topological spaces.
                    <br><br>
                    My goal is to eventually conduct research in mathematics and be able to help people understand
                    the beauty and complexities of mathematics in an accessible manner.
                </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    My main interests lie in pure mathematics, particularly in abstract algebra and topology, 
                    where I enjoy exploring how algebraic structures and geometric intuition interact.  
                    I’m also passionate about mathematics education — finding clear and creative ways to communicate 
                    complex ideas through writing, visualization, and teaching.  
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond pure math, I have a growing interest in cybersecurity, especially in defensive security 
                    and how mathematical reasoning and systems thinking contribute to building secure architectures.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    Outside of study, I enjoy reading philosophy, particularly in logic and ethics, where reasoning and morality intersect.  
                    <br><br>
                    I’m also an avid football fan and have been supporting Chelsea since 2010.  
                    <br><br>
                    In my spare time, I play video games such as <em>Valorant</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>, as well as single(-ish)-player games. Some of my
                    all time favorites are 
                    <em>Bioshock</em> (1 and Infinite), <em>Civilization VI</em>, and <em>Genshin Impact</em>.  
                </p>

                <h2>Writings</h2>
                <p>Below is a link to my mathematics exposition that I have been writing throughout
                    my time in university. It contains expository papers on topics such as the concept of
                    π, Fermat's Little Theorem and the insolvability of quintics, which directly refers to Galois' work.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also currently in the process of writing up an exposition on the K(π, 1) conjecture by attending
                    an ongoing PhD seminar going through tools and concepts required to understand Deligne's paper.

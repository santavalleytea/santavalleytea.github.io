            Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and you'll most likely notice that everyone's suddenly
            an expert; nutritionists, psychologists, climate scientists all conveniently broadcasting
            their self-proclaimed expertise in front of their phones or computer. The internet has a wide
            range of sources that you can certainly learn from &mdash; I sure have plenty of times. However,
            it seems to me that the internet has also turned into a kind of classroom, where supposed facts are laid out for
            viewers to consume &mdash; except nobody's quite sure who the teacher is.
            <br><br>
            We currently live in an age where confidence and authority implies competence. Notice the 
            abundance of mildly (or even explicitly) click-baity titles: <i>"The Morning Routine That Made Me Rich"</i>
            when it's simply an advertisement of their clothing product, <i>"Fruits Are Bad For You"</i> talking
            about how the sugar content of certain fruits can be as high as a piece of candy, without addressing
            the nuance in the structure of sugars that both fruits and processed sweets contain, and 
            <i>"Vaccines Are Bad For You"</i> because the very person claiming this knew of two people who have had bad 
            experiences regarding vaccines. The point is this: many claim such statements to be true
            without any real credibility behind them. This is where a combination of psychology and
            logic enters.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Dunning-Kruger Effect</b></h3>
            Back in 1999, psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger discovered a cognitive bias;
            that people who know very little about a topic tend to overestimate their understanding of it
            <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.
            The reasoning is poetic and ironic: if you lack the knowledge on a particular topic, you also lack
            the ability to recognize how much knowledge you lack on that same topic. Simply put, one requires
            expertise to realize the difficulty of expertise. 
            <br><br>
            On platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, this very effect turns into a feature, not a bug.
            With just a sprinkle of confidence along with a trendy title, all of a sudden one's overly biased
            and half-baked opinion on climate change not only outperforms peer-reviewed papers, but also creates a career
            for them, where they can continue the cycle &mdash; if it works now, why wouldn't it keep working?
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Logical Fallacies</b></h3>
            I wanted to spend a bit of time writing on logical fallacies. This is still relevant and highlights
            how shallow reasoning often sneaks in to seemingly factual statements. 
            There are two kinds of fallacies I want to focus on: the <i>appeal to authority</i> 
            and the <i>slippery slope</i> &mdash; both of which I have seen quite often when it comes to self-proclaimed experts and their
            take on whatever's trending that day.
            <br><br>
            The appeal to authority fallacy happens when someone claims that something is true because some <i>"expert"</i>
            said so. This is <b>everywhere</b> on social media. For example, one might watch a fitness influencer telling them
            that a particular diet triumphs all other diets, and they might sit there and think to themselves: 
            "This influencer has a six-pack, therefore his advice on diet must be true". Another example may be that a 
            doctor said vaccines are bad, therefore it must be true &mdash; while not acknowledging what kind of doctor they are.
            Even if the doctor were to be legitimate, unfortunately there are plenty of cases when even legitimate experts don't
            necessarily tell you what is actually true, but rather to fit an agenda of theirs. The point is this, real expertise isn't
            about one's confidence or titles, it is simply about evidence. So the fallacy here isn't to not listen to experts &mdash;
            it's the failure to check which kind. 
            <br><br>
            Another all too common fallacy is the slippery slope. It argues that one small step will inevitably lead to a 
            disastrous outcome. When explaining the slippery slope fallacy, I tend to point to the COVID19 pandemic, and 
            how people of various views and background made arguments against mandates. For example, <i>"If they can make you take
            a shot of vaccine, they can make you take any drug they want".</i> It's quite clear here that one simply doesn't
            imply the other. It takes a limited, one-time health measure to a dystopian future of bodily control &mdash; a
            classic slipper slope argument.    
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Does The Internet Reward Ignorance?</b></h3>
            No one can say for certain that the internet does in fact reward ignorance. However, the problem seems to be that
            algorithms don't necessarily reward careful thinking, rather, they reward certainty. Certainty implying view counts. 
            Many answers, especially in the sciences, require complex nuance to get the point across. Often times, it is not 
            necessary that it is a simple black or white answer. However, if a confident influencer jumps in and tells the public
            that <i>"They have been lying to you"</i>, turns out the latter generates more views than the former. This 
            illustrates the phenomenon that the Dunning-Kruger effect meets the engagement criteria that is evident on 
            social media platforms &mdash; and the result is a worldwide ensemble of confident nonsense. 
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Humility of Knowing</b></h3>
            The more you learn about something, the more you become aware of what you don't know. From my perspective,
            humility is the opposite of what goes viral in this day and age, but it is the foundation of proper
            understanding. The solution to this isn't cynicism, but rather, curiosity. So next time you're met with a
            claim that bothers you, instead of shouting out counter arguments fueled by bias or emotion, 
            ask questions, verify those claims and stop confusing someone speaking loudly for someone being right. 
            In the end, the point of 
            this blog isn't about "other" people &mdash; it's about all of us including myself. We've all had moments 
            where we were overconfident in our understanding after learning very little. The challenge here is to be aware that real understanding
            takes a lot of patience, humility and sometimes, the wisdom to just simply keep scrolling.

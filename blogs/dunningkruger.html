            Scroll through Instagram or TikTok and you'll notice something interesting &mdash;
            everyone's suddenly an expert. 
            Nutritionists, psychologists and climate scientists all conveniently broadcasting
            their self-proclaimed expertise in front of their devices. The internet is, without a doubt,
            a place containing a wide range of sources that you can certainly learn from &mdash; I've learned plenty from it myself. 
            However, it seems to me that the internet has also turned into a kind of classroom, 
            where supposed facts are laid out for the
            viewers to consume &mdash; except nobody's quite sure who the teacher is.
            <br><br>
            We currently live in an age where confidence and authority implies competence. Notice the 
            abundance of mildly (or even explicitly) click-baity titles: <i>"The Morning Routine That Made Me Rich"</i>
            when it's nothing more than an advertisement for their clothing product, <i>"Fruits Are Bad For You"</i> due
            to the sugar content of certain fruits, without addressing
            the nuance in the structure of sugars between fruits and processed sugars, and 
            <i>"Vaccines Are Bad For You"</i>, justified by a couple of
            anecdotal stories. The point is this: many claim such statements to be true
            without any real credibility behind them. This is where both psychology and
            logic start to matter.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Dunning-Kruger Effect</b></h3>
            In 1999, psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger discovered a cognitive bias
            now known as the <b>Dunning-Kruger effect</b> &mdash;
            that people who know very little about a topic tend to overestimate their understanding of it
            <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.
            The irony is quite poetic: if you lack the knowledge on a particular topic, you also lack
            the ability to recognize how much knowledge you lack. Simply put, one requires
            expertise to realize the difficulty of expertise. 
            <br><br>
            On platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, this very effect turns into a feature, not a bug.
            With just a sprinkle of confidence, short form structure and a trendy title, all of a sudden one's half-baked opinion on
            climate change not only outperforms peer-reviewed papers, but also turns into a profitable career.
            When that formula works, why would any stop?
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Logical Fallacies</b></h3>
            Another piece of this puzzle lies in how these ideas are put forth. The following highlights
            how shallow reasoning often sneaks in to seemingly factual statements. 
            There are two kinds of fallacies that I find quite often: the <i>appeal to authority</i> 
            and the <i>slippery slope</i>.
            <br><br>
            The appeal to authority fallacy occurs when something is claimed to be true because an <i>"expert"</i>
            said so. Social media thrives on this. For example, one might watch a fitness influencer telling them
            that a particular diet triumphs all other diets, and they might sit there and think to themselves: 
            "This influencer has a six-pack, therefore his advice on diet must be true". Another example may be that a 
            doctor says vaccines are bad, therefore it must be true &mdash; without acknowledging what kind of doctor they are.
            Even if the doctor were to be legitimate, unfortunately there are plenty of cases when credentials don't
            necessarily tell you what is actually true. The point is this, real expertise isn't
            about one's confidence or titles, it's about evidence. The fallacy here isn't in listening to experts;
            it's in failing to check which kind in particular.
            <br><br>
            Another all too common fallacy is the slippery slope. It argues that one small step will inevitably lead to a 
            disastrous outcome. When explaining the slippery slope fallacy, I tend to point to the COVID19 pandemic, and 
            how arguments were made against certain mandates. For example, <i>"If they can make you take
            a shot of vaccine, they can make you take any drug they want".</i> It's quite clear here that othe logic 
            breaks down on inspection &mdash; one public health measure doesn't automatically lead to some form of 
            dystopian bodily control. It's a leap built on fear rather than reason.   
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Does The Internet Reward Ignorance?</b></h3>
            It's difficult to say for certain that the internet truly rewards ignorance, but it certainly
            rewards certainty. Algorirthms favor engagement, not nuance. Careful thinking, which often consists of gray
            areas and conditional statements, rarely goes viral.
            Complex questions, whether it be in politics or science, often don't have simple answers. However, if a confident influencer jumps in 
            to tell the public
            that <i>"They have been lying to us!"</i>, turns out the latter generates more views than the former. This 
            illustrates the phenomenon where the Dunning-Kruger effect meets the social-media algorithms: confidence
            gets views, and views amplify confidence. The result is a worldwide ensemble of confident nonsense. 
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Humility of Knowing</b></h3>
            The more you learn about something, the more you become aware of what you don't know. From my perspective,
            humility may not be the current trend, but it's the foundation of genuine
            understanding. The solution to this isn't cynicism, but rather, curiosity. Next time you're met with a
            claim that bothers you, resist the urge to shout out counter arguments fueled by bias and emotion. Instead, 
            ask questions, verify those claims and stop confusing someone speaking loudly for someone being right. 
            Ultimately, the point of 
            this blog isn't about "other" people &mdash; it's about all of us including myself. We've all had moments 
            where we were overconfident in our understanding after learning very little. The challenge here is to remember that real understanding
            takes a lot of patience, humility and sometimes, the wisdom to just keep scrolling.

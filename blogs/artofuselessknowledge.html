            It's quite evident from the expositions on this website that I indulge in what 
            is called <i>pure mathematics</i> or â€” as I like to describe it, <i>math for the sake of math</i>. 
            To some, that may sound like a bunch of abstract nonsense: concepts with no clear use, and honestly,
            they're not entirely wrong.
            <br><br>
            I often find myself in conversations where someone asks me, <i>"So what do you do with a math degree?</i>
            or <i>"What exactly do you learn?"</i> &mdash; questions that make me pause and wonder how to answer without sounding 
            like a man who's lost his mind.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Applied vs. Pure</b></h3>
            Broadly speaking, mathematics can be split into two large areas: <b>applied</b> and <b>pure</b>. 
            Applied mathematics is, as its name suggests, applicable &mdash; it finds use in various
            fields outside of mathematics such as physics, engineering, biology, computer science, finance and so on. In other words,
            it's the mathematics that helps model motion, optimize systems and make predictions. 
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, pure mathematics exists largely for itself. It's the study of ideas independent from application such as
            algebraic structures in abstract algebra, or deformation of objects in topology, where the rather unusual statement that a 
            coffee cup is "the same" as a donut somehow makes mathematical sense. At first glance, applied math appears far more useful...
            and it is. This is precisely what makes the question <i>why study pure mathematics?</i> both interesting and complex. 
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Why Study Something "Useless"?</b></h3>
            It's honestly a fair question. We're taught from early on that mathematics finds its value due to its use &mdash; it helps
            engineers build bridges, computer scientists code algorithms and space engineers launch rockets. So why would anyone devote years
            of effort to understand something that doesn't seem to do any of those things?
            <br><br>
            For me, the answer is simple; curiosity. Pure mathematics is less about practicality and more about following a story &mdash;
            wanting to know where the idea goes from one point to another.

            Consider a formula that many have seen before:
            $$
                x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
            $$
            This expression, called the <i>quadratic formula</i>, lets us find solutions to polynomial equations. Now, think about something
            seemingly unrelated: a square.
            <center><img src="../img/square.png" alt=""></center>
            The red dotted lines show what is called the lines of symmetry. In other words, you can
            rotate or reflect the square along these lines and still end up with the same shape &mdash; its structure is preserved.
            <br><br>
            Now what if I told you that this simple symmetry is connected to that formula above?
            This is where <b>Galois theory</b> comes into play: the study of how
            the symmetries of a structure (also known as <i>groups</i>) correspond to the solvability of polynomial equations.
            It's through this theory that we learn why equations of degree five and higher
            &mdash; such as \(x^5 - x + 1 = 0\)  &mdash; do not have a universal formula like the quadratic does. 
            <br><br>
            This is the kind of set up that draws people into pure mathematics. 
            It begins with something familiar and ends up somewhere unexpected.  Every proof feels to me like a narrative:
            a mystery set up, a journey through the reasoning via logic, and an ending that feels inevitable once 
            you've seen it. It is worth noting that the example I gave above involves studying deeply abstract and complex 
            mathematics, which takes quite a lot of time and effort to understand. However, it is extremely rewarding and one 
            that I certainly enjoyed studying, looking back on it.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Beyond Usefulness</b></h3>
            Despite what I said earlier, pure mathematics turns out to be a lot more useful than 
            it presents itself to be. Abstract algebra is used throughout cryptography and computer graphics, topology finds its way into
            computer networks, data science and even image processing. But to me, these are not reasons to study pure mathematics &mdash;
            rather a side effect.
            <br><br>
            Most people who find interest in studying this field don't do so because it might one day help out with their day to day life.
            They do it because of the <i>beauty</i> of the ideas themselves &mdash; because these structures, proofs and patterns
            form a kind of art.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>In The End</b></h3>
            Perhaps the value of pure mathematics isn't in what it provides, but in what it represents. I like to see it as a way of 
            celebrating curiosity &mdash; of asking questions simply because they exist and are worth asking. It's an act of 
            imagination, of seeing a story in an abstract setting. 
            <br><br>
            In a world where people are obsessed with productivity and tangible outcomes, pure mathematics offer something I consider to be
            rare: a reminder that some of the most meaningful pursuits have little to no purpose beyond itself &mdash; and that's 
            precisely what makes them worthwhile.

        <p>
            For a long time, mathematics has been regarded as the purest form of reason and a 
            language that guarantees certainty. Before the existence of equations and proofs as
            we know it today, philosophers looked for methods of reasoning that could guarantee
            truth purely by structure. 
            <br><br>
            In <i>Organon</i>, Aristotle laid the foundation of <b>formal logic</b>, which is conceived to be
            the study of inference. That is, the general principles by which, given a set of true assertions, one can
            arrive at conclusions that must also be true, via a series of indubitable steps. A classic example is the
            following:
            <br><br>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <i>All men are mortal. <br>
                    Socrates is a man. <br>
                    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</i>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            This is an example of a deductive argument, in particular, a <b>syllogism</b>. Note here that the validity
            of it depends not on the content, but rather the form &mdash; if the two initial premises are true, then 
            the conclusion must also be true. 
            <br><br>
            A few decades later, Euclid's <i>Elements</i> expanding on this vision from logical reasoning to the
            field of mathematics. In what became the idea of <b>axiomatic method</b>, Euclid began with a finite 
            set of <i>axioms</i> &mdash; simple and self-evident truths such as "Objects equal to the same thing are 
            equal to one another" &mdash; and derived carefully, through a number of steps, the geometry of the plane.
            Each theorem followed by necessity, as though reason itself was the driving force to mathematical truths.
            <br><br>
            This idea that all mathematical truths may ultimately be deduced from a consistent set of axioms became one
            of the guiding methods of modern mathematics. Even as new fields emerged, such as topology, abstract algebra etc., 
            the Euclidean ideal remained: mathematics is and should be a perfectly ordered deductive system. 
            <br><br>
            Fast forwarding into the twentieth century, this ideal (or dream) reached new heights by the German 
            mathematician's proposal that all of mathematics could, in principle, be formalized. His vision, which 
            was later known as <i>Hilbert's Program</i> sought not only to <i>complete</i> mathematics, but to prove
            that it could never contradict itself; in his famous words: <i>“Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen.”</i>
            ("We must know. We will know.")
            <br><br>
            However, unfortunately for Hilbert, this grand dream of his was faced with an unexpected yet profound obstacle
            laid out by a young logician <b>Kurt Gödel</b>, who showed that a complete and self-consistent mathematical
            system was impossible.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>Formal Systems and Arithmetic</b></h3>
            Hilbert's dream was dependent on the belief that reasoning itself could be reduced to a mechanical process.
            If every mathematical statement could be represented by a finite string of symbols, and if there were 
            clear rules for how those strings were to be manipulated, then all mathematical truth could be derived
            systematically.
            <br><br>
            Formally, define a <b>formal system</b> \(F\) as a triple <center>\(F = (\Sigma, A, R)\)</center>
            where:
            <ul style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li>\(\Sigma\) is a <b>finite alphabet</b> &mdash; a collection of symbols used to build expressions.
                    For example, \(\{0, S, +, \times, =, \forall, \exists, \ldots\}\).
                </li>
                <li>\(A \subseteq \Sigma^*\) is a set of <b>axioms</b>; formulas taken
                    to be true without proof.
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(R\) is a set of <b>rules of inference</b>, which describes how to derive new strings (theorems)
                    from old ones.
                </li>
            </ul>
            A <b>theorem</b> is any formula that can be obtained from the axioms by finitely many application of these
            rules. We write this \(A \vdash \varphi \) to mean that \(\varphi\) is <i>provable</i> from \(A\). Note that
            \(\varphi\) is just a formula or statement in logic. 
            <br><br>
            A classic example of a formal system is the <b>Peano Arithmetic</b>. It is a way of writing down the
            basic truths about the natural numbers \(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\) using only symbols and logical rules. 
            <br><br>
            The system has a small "alphabet" of symbols such as <center>\(0, S, +, \times, =, \forall\)</center>
            in addition to others, but this will suffice for now. Here, \(\forall\) means "for all" and \(S(x)\)
            means "the successor of \(x\)" &mdash; in other words, the number that comes right after \(x\). So 
            \(S(0)\) is 1, \(S(S(0))\) is 2 and so on. Then, we write a few <b>axioms</b>; statements that we 
            take to be true without proof. For example:
            <ul style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li>\(\forall x(S(x) \neq 0)\) &mdash; 0 is not the successor of any number.</li>
                <li>\(\forall x(x + 0 = x)\) &mdash; adding \(0\) doesn't change a number.</li>
                <li>\(\forall x \forall y (x + S(y) = S(x+y))\) &mdash; adding a successor is like taking the successor after adding.</li>
            </ul>
            Finally, there is a rule called <b>induction</b>, whereby if something is true for \(0\), and if whenever
            it's true for \(x\) it's also true for \(S(x)\), then it must be true for <i>all</i> numbers.
            <br><br>
            This is simply it. From just these starting points, the Peano Arithmetic can describe everything 
            we normally do with whole numbers &mdash; whether it be addition, multiplication and even deeper
            theorems that stems from the axioms, all through the manipulation of symbols. 
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Gödel Sentence</b></h3>
            Hilbert's vision assumed that any mathematical truth could be captured by these formal symbols. Gödel took
            this idea, and his genius, was to use those same symbols to show the limits of the system itself. He started 
            off with a simple idea: basic arithmetic can describe basic arithmetic. 
            <br><br>
            Every symbol, such as \(0, S, +, \times, =, \forall, \implies, - , (, ),\ldots\) can be assigned a unique number.
            For example, you might set \(0 \mapsto 1\), \(S \mapsto 2\), \(+ \mapsto 3\), \(\times \mapsto 4\) and so on. 
            Then, a whole formula &mdash; say \(\forall x (S(x) \neq 0)\) &mdash; can be turned into a single number by
            combining these codes uniquely. Gödel used what is called <b>prime numbers:</b>
            <center>
                \(\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner = 2^{n_1}3^{n_2}5^{n_3}\cdots p_k^{n_k}\)
            </center>
            where \(n_i\) is the number assigned to the \(i\)-th symbol in \(\varphi\), and \(p_i\) is the \(i\)-th prime.
            Thus, every formula, proof or even a sequence of proofs can be represented as a unique number &mdash; called
            its <b>Gödel number</b>.
            <br><br>
            Once we have this set up, we can describe syntactic relations arithmetically. To do this, define a relation
            <center>\(\operatorname{Proof}_F (p,n)\)</center>
            which means "\(p\) is the Gödel number of a valid proof in the system \(F\) of the formula whose Gödel number
            is \(n\)". This importance here is that this relation can be expressed as an arithmetic formula. That is, 
            the system can internally verify whether a number encodes a correct proof.
            <br><br>
            From here, Gödel defined what's called a <b>provability predicate</b>
            <center>\(\operatorname{Provable}_F(n) := \exists p \operatorname{Proof}_F(p,n)\)</center>
            where the left hand side reads: "there exists a number \(p\) that encodes a proof of the statement with 
            number \(n\)". So within arithmetic itself, we can construct a sentence such as, 
            <center>\(\operatorname{Provable})_F(\ulcorner 2 + 2 = 4 \urcorner)\)</center>
            which means, "the formula \(2 + 2 = 4\) is provable in \(F\)".
            <br><br>
            Here comes the most interesting and key part of the story. Gödel built a statement that refers to its own
            Gödel number. He did so by considering the formula
            <center>\(\neg \operatorname{Provable}_F(x)\)</center>
            which states "the formula with Gödel number \(x\) is not provable in \(F\)". By substituting the number
            of that very formula into itself, Gödel obtained a sentence \(G\) such that, 
            <center>\(F \vdash G \leftrightarrow \neg \operatorname{Provable}_F(\ulcorner G \urcorner)\)</center>
            In words, \(G\) asserts the following:
            <blockquote>
                <p><i>"The statement with Gödel number \(\ulcorner G \urcorner\) (that is, this very sentence) is
                    is not provable in \(F\)."</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            This is precisely the <b>Gödel sentence</b>. What's interesting here is that it is self-refential, but not
            in a way that is ridiculously paradoxical, but every piece of the assertion is encoded precisely as arithmetic.
            <br><br>
            Now, we are left with two possible options:
            <ol style="margin-left: 3em;">
                <li>
                    If \(F \vdash G\): the system proves a statement claiming it is <i>not provable</i>.
                    This gives a contradiction &mdash; so \(F\) would be inconsistent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If \(F \nvdash G\): then \(G\) is unprovable in \(F\). But this is precisely what \(G\) states.
                    Thus, \(G\) is true, despite the inability of \(F\) to prove it.
                </li>    
            </ol>
            Hence, if \(F\) is consistent, then \(G\) is true but unprovable. This is <b>Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem</b>.
            It states that if \(F\) is consistent and capable of expressing via arithmetic, then \(F\) is incomplete. There
            will always exist statements \(G\) such that neither \(G\) nor \(\neg G\) is provable in \(F\).
            <br><br>
            Without going in to too much detail, Gödel pushed the argument one step further. Let \(\operatorname{Cons}
            (F)\) be a formula stating that "\(F\) is consistent". He showed that if \(F\) is consistent, then it cannot
            prove this fact about itself:
            <center>\(F \nvdash \operatorname{Cons}(F)\)</center>
            So not only are there true but unprovable statements, the system cannot even prove its own soundness to begin
            with.
            <br><br>
            <h3><b>The Limit of Formal Systems</b></h3>
            Hilbert's dream was to prove that mathematics is both complete and consistent. However, this dream of his
            had vanished when Gödel showed that these two simple could not coexist &mdash; if the system is consistent, it cannot
            be complete, and if it is complete, it cannot be consistent.
            <br><br>
            Take the following analogy as an example. Suppose you pick up a book that claims that a particular
            statement is a legitimate fact. Now, if this "system" can formally verify itself, it would be like 
            checking the accuracy of the book using only the contents of the same book. If there is an error,
            the book has no way of stepping outside itself to realize such an error. To truly confirm it, you would
            require a reference that is beyond the book. This is what Gödel showed &mdash; mathematics too, needs to
            step outside any one formal system to see its own consistency.
            <br><br>
            It is however, important to note that this outcome wasn't a failure of mathematics as a subject, 
            but rather a revelation. While mathematics is and most likely will still be considered as the 
            "language of logic" or in some cases "language of truth", that mathematical truth will always
            reach beyond the formal rules we write to capture it. That is, there will always be truths that no finite
            system of symbols can contain.
